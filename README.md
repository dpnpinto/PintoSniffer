# PintoSniffer

## This project aims to create a comprehensive system for evaluating LAN communication and alerting the administrator to any suspicious activity.

The following are some preliminary tests I've conducted, involving frame evaluation with a large language model (LLM) and real-time data acquisition. I will use the smallest available computer for this project and share the results.

At the moment using:
- Linux (Arch/Alpine)
- BASH
- SMTP
- PGP
- Wireshark
- Ollama
- DeepSeek-r1 1.8B
